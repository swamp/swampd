# swampd

> pronounced "Swamped"

Early preview! swampd is an experimental daemon that embeds the Swamp scripting VM, exposes a
minimal UDP interface, and provides a simple keyâ€“value storage layer. Itâ€™s in its infancy, so donâ€™t
expect a lot of bells and whistles - yet. In future releases, `swampd` will become a fully featured
package combining:

- Embedded Swamp scripting: compile and run Swamp scripts on the fly
- Network interface: lightweight UDP-based RPC to your scripts
- Simple storage: a keyâ€“value store (sled?) for persistent state

## Install DB

```sh
brew install keydb
```

- Configure persistence (in `/opt/homebrew/etc/keydb.conf`):

```text
save 60 1000
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec
```

- Start it up

```sh
keydb-server /opt/homebrew/etc/keydb.conf
```

or

```sh
brew services start keydb
```

- Connect & inspect

```sh
keydb-cli ping        # -> PONG
keydb-cli set foo bar # -> OK
keydb-cli get foo     # -> "bar"
```
